# NurseryRhymes

This repo is for Brainy Make-A-Rhyme Android for Team Rhyme or Reason.
The current application is in prototype demonstration stages, and has not been tested for widespread device compatability.
The application is known to render properly on the Google Pixel 2 XL, API 28.

The demonstration of the application allows users to take quizzes to unlock words. The demo does not incorporate persistence between application launches, and not all words and categories have been loaded into the application. The Help button currently is not enabled; this is not considered a priority for our client, and as a result it is purely there as a placeholder.
